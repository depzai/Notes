1108 Meeting:
-------------

- 2 items: 
	o reftag instrumentation epic
	o owners for other proj plan items
- Reftag Instrumentation:
	o quick background: the funnel report will be all reftag-driven so we need very robust mapping and metadata for all reftags in use
	o First element: mapping is needed so we can store all the metadata (channel, activity, surface, campaign) to generate the funnel report
	o Second Element: we need to get a handle on the reftag generation and mapping going forward, so it can all be automated. So we need your help define a solution
	o This meeting: think through next steps to start this

- Owners: who should we follow up with: could you the 2 of you or someone else that, so we have a SPOC

REFTAGS:
========
We create our reftags if the page is controlled by Audible
Notes:
- Based on feedback from Carter, mapping all reftags relevant to impressions and visits is not possible since some of those are automatically generated and hard to track
- Recommendation is for the BI team to do a one-off analysis of the available data and come back with a mapping with % of traffic for each bucket.
- The analysis will highlight the gaps in ref tag mapping and the impact on the overall reporting:
	o Ref tags easily identifiable with metadata available
	o Ref tags with no medadata available
	o Ref tags that are hard to track
	o % of traffic going through all these groups
- Based on those findings, BI will ask for the product & marketing team's guidance on how to tackle the gaps and automate the mapping and instrumentation of future ref tags
