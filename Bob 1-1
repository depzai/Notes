Backlog:
-----------------
- Amazon Dashboard
- App release dashboard
- Sonos Reporting
- App Home / Sonos reporting

Idea Backlog:
------------------
	- We get a lot of calls on stats and badges. We don't invest in it, do people care about it?
	- Push notifications: can we understand how to use them to reduce our churn rate?
	- Why so many playback errors?


TOA:
- Check with Bolong on the timing

====================================

10/03 Mtg:
===============

CAR MODE - PPT:
----------------

Amazon Reporting:
-------------------
- Shell / Mock Up ready
- Awaiting final structure from Marketing team
- Ref Tag Mapping for Retail and Kindle in Progress: should be done this week
- Ref Tag consistency will be key: need to make them consistent and queryable
- eReader will have to be in v2
- Alexa has proposed structure
- Actual implementation of report will take some heavy lifting - help needed

Backlog:
-----------
- App health report - awaiting word from Yohanes (proposal being reviewed)
- Car Mode being finalized
- SSO Report and then Sonos and App Home
- Instrumentation issue: working on a proposal to have it instrumented by Maddy


Site and App Strategy:
-----------------------
- We need smart instrumentation: clickstream, FCT device etc.




10/16 - Mtg:
======================

Backlog could consist of the following:

1. Site and Apps strategy paper
	o Formulate the App priority
	o Formulate problem:
		- Basic app instrumentation for Apps
		- Web instrumentation: mapping issue, site as a potential solution
		- Amazon mapping and instrumentation issue
	o Benefit of working site cat or web tracking:
		- Detailed tracking needed for Site cat at Action code level
		- Detailed URL availables, useful for tracking promotions, or specific pages?
		- Data available in real time
		- Cost Benefit analysis vs. clickstream option
	

2. Apps implementation with new solution put forth by Product Team

3. Proposed strategic workstreams (backlog):
	- What is the impact of customer onboarding on LTV (TOA deep dive)?
	- Do features that promote engagement result in better LTV (Car Mode)?
	- Customer segmentation by product usage:
		o Browsing platforms
		o Multiple device usage
		o App interactions
		o Listening behavior

TOA Deep Dive:
==============

Question 1: Is acquisition increasing?
	- Yes, A/B testing showed it

Question 2: How are users responding to the product?
	- Toaster views
	- Actions after toaster views

Question 3: Optimization areas
	- Toaster click-through rate
	- Email click-through rate
	- Can we use push notifications

Question 4: Is onboarding creating better customers:
	- Usage during trial
	- Are users finding a better book for their trial
	- Are users better at finding books as members
	- App usage for TOA members vs. non-TOA
	- Credit usage, RPM, Retention
	- Interactions with apps, finding content etc. (are we not 'training them to find content in the app?')


1-1 11/15 BACKLOG:
==================

1 apps:
-------
	o Driving the project from BI
	o PArt of vendor selection
	o Put together BI criteria, specifically on data access
	o Will work closely with vendor on data definition and instrumentation
	o Will build reporting and measurement to be rolled out once solution is in place

2 sitecat:
----------
Why Sitecat:
	o Business Need is being formulated
	o Tool is there and underutilized
	o To power BI initiatives:
		- Define and track L2-L3 metrics
		- Multi-platform behavioral analytics
		- UX performance measuring
		- New Features 

High-level plan:
	o Discovery phase (business needs) - 2 weeks
	o Explore current implementation - BI exercise
	o Explore in-house solution - Tech/BI
	o Explore other options
	o Come up with plan and drive implementation


3 Weblab measurement:
---------------------
	o A/B testing will be available in apps: we need to develop the practice in that space
	o Explore need for UX-specific weblabs
	o Web: expand weblabs to include downstream impact and integrate new data available with sitecat option

4 Deep Dives:
-------------
	o TOA deep dive
	o Car Mode / new feature deep dive
