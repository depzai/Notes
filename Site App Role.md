#Site & App Strategy Role:
*Bruno Dupont, 11/21/2017*

This is a summarized vision for the Site & App Strategy role.

Based on early conversations with the Product team (And specifically in the mobile space), the need for strategic analytics is predicated on laying a solid reporting foundation for both iOS and Android:

- Basic app health reporting, including app release dashboards
- New Feature reporting (for PI epics such as Car Mode and App Home)

The main issue to address going in is the lack of reliable data, which is why data instrumentation in the App space is a priority. 

Once reporting in place, there will be an opportunity for targeted deep dives that will inform the Product Team's strategy going forward.

Below is a proposed list of backlog items for the Site & App Strategy Role going forward.


##1. App Strategy â€“ Instrumentation:
The app instrumentation project has been driven by Maddy on the Product team. The Site & App Strategy Role has consisted so far in:

- Providing detailed BI requirements in the RFI process
- Meeting with vendors and take part in the  vendor selection process

Once the vendor has been selected and the work starts, the role will be critical in:

- Defining metrics and metadata to be created and collected
- Determining the way BI accesses the data
- Building reporting and measurement once the solution is in place

##2. Adobe Analytics for Web (Site Catalyst):

Why focus on Site Catalyst?

- A business need is being formulated by the marketing team: BI should be driving the process and help define the best solution (whether or not it is Site Catalyst)
- The Tool itself is (partially) implemented and highly underutilized
- A research spike is needed to assess the true value that can be derived from Site Catalyst data, especially compared to in-house systems like Clickstream
- A strong web analytics platform is needed to power BI initiatives, such as:
	- Defining and tracking L2-L3 metrics for PI initiatives
	- Multi-platform behavioral analytics (app and web)
	- UX performance measuring
	- Monitoring New Features 

High-level plan:

- Discovery phase (business needs) - +/-2 weeks
- Explore current implementation - BI exercise
- Explore in-house solution - Tech/BI
- Explore other options
- Come up with plan and drive implementation


##3. Analytics

####Weblab measurement:

- A/B testing will be available in apps: we need to develop the practice in that space
- Explore need for UX-specific weblabs
- Web: expand weblabs to include downstream impact

####Deep Dives:

- TOA deep dive
- Car Mode / new feature deep dive
- App Home deep dive
